## Description
This is a simple Memory game.
The aim of the game is to find all matching pairs among randomly distributed cards, flipping two cards face up over each turn.

## Instructions
To play the game simply load the page and start clicking on the cards. A card will flip face up and stay this way until you flip another one. If the cards chosen match, the pair will be marked as guessed (e.g. turn green, smaller and stay flipped face up until the end of the game). If the cards do not match, you will have 2 seconds to memorize the positioning, after this time the cards will flip back. You have unlimited number of moves, however the final ranking depends solely on that number (the greater the number the worse the ranking).

At any time you can reset the game by clicking the "RESET" button. After finishing the game, if you wish to play one more time, use the "PLAY AGAIN" button.

## Other
The game uses local storage to store the best score.
Cards are randomly shuffled using Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.
